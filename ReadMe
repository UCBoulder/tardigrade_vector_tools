A collection of tools for C++ that make interfacing with vectors easier and 
less prone to error. These tools also allow the user access to the powerful 
Eigen library which provides matrix utilities in such a way that Eigen does 
not need to be used explicitly in the user's code.

Note: In order to use the Intel compiler one must run the following command 
in a bash prompt:
source /apps/intel2016/bin/ifortvars.sh -arch intel64 -platform linux

This is the same command that the abaqus command issues. It may be that 
this command will change on different platforms.
